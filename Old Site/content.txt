FAQ Content:

What is a hackathon?

Why hack?

What is VR?
Virtual Reality applications place the user in a virtual world where they are not able to see the real world. At the bare minimum, their head rotations change their point of view. Higher end devices have spatial tracking, allowing movement and 6 DOF controllers allowing for natural interaction. Great for interactive experiences!

What is AR?
Augmented Reality applications overlay computer graphics on the real world. Has a lot of potential for practical applications!

What is MR?
Mixed Reality is a process where real camera footage of a person playing a VR game is overlaid with the game visuals, giving a third person perspective of the game. See this video for an example! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx-esx_KbJE)
